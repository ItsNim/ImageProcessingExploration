# Study Plan: Computer Vision with Python

## Week 1
- Learn the basics of Python programming language, if you haven't already. I recommend the official Python documentation as a resource (`https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/`).
- Read Chapter 1-4 of "Programming Computer Vision with Python" by Jan Erik Solem. This book provides a great introduction to computer vision with Python and covers topics like image acquisition, color models, image enhancement, and more.
- Project: Write a Python program that reads an image, converts it to grayscale, and saves the result.

## Week 2
- Read Chapter 5-6 of "Programming Computer Vision with Python". These chapters cover image segmentation and feature extraction.
- Project: Write a Python program that applies thresholding to an image and extracts its edges.

## Week 3
- Read Chapter 7-9 of "Programming Computer Vision with Python". These chapters cover morphological image processing, image filtering, and image restoration.
- Project: Write a Python program that applies various filters to an image, such as Gaussian and median filters.

## Week 4
- Learn about classical network architectures for computer vision, such as LeNet, AlexNet, and VGG. I recommend the following resources:
  - "Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition" by LeCun et al.: `http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-98.pdf`
  - "ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks" by Krizhevsky et al.: `https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf`
- Project: Train a neural network to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Week 5
- Learn about transfer learning for computer vision, which is a technique that allows you to use pre-trained models for your own tasks. I recommend the following resources:
  - "Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition" by Simonyan and Zisserman: `https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf`
  - "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition" by He et al.: `https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf`
- Project: Fine-tune a pre-trained model for image classification using the transfer learning technique.

## Week 6
- Learn about object detection in computer vision, which is the task of detecting objects within an image. I recommend the following resources:
  - "You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection" by Redmon et al.: `https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02640.pdf`
  - "Faster R-CNN: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with Region Proposal Networks" by Ren et al.: `https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.01497.pdf`
- Project: Implement an object detection algorithm to detect objects within an image.

## Week 7
- Learn about object tracking in computer vision, which is the task of following a moving object across a video. I recommend the following resources:
  - "Simple Online and Realtime Tracking with a Deep Association Metric" by Wojke et al.: `https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.07402.pdf`
  - "Deep SORT: Simple Online and Realtime Tracking with a Deep Association Metric" by Wojeke et al.: `https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.07402.pdf`
- Project: Implement an object tracking algorithm to follow a moving object across a video.
## Week 8
- Learn about deep convolutional models for computer vision, which are used to solve complex tasks such as semantic segmentation and image captioning. I recommend the following resources:
  - "Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation" by Long et al.: `https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4038.pdf`
  - "Show and Tell: A Neural Image Caption Generator" by Vinyals et al.: `https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf`
- Project: Implement a deep convolutional model for semantic segmentation or image captioning.

## Week 9
- Learn about object detection with deep learning, which is an approach that combines deep learning with traditional object detection techniques. I recommend the following resources:
  - "Single Shot MultiBox Detector" by Liu et al.: `https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.02325.pdf`
  - "Mask R-CNN" by He et al.: `https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.06870.pdf`
- Project: Implement an object detection algorithm using deep learning.

## Week 10
- Learn about image processing techniques used in diffusion modes and stable diffusion. I recommend the following resources:
  - "Anisotropic Diffusion in Image Processing" by Perona and Malik: `https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/535416/`
  - "Stable Solutions of Inverse Problems" by Burger and Osher: `https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/S0036142901389530`
- Project: Implement an image processing algorithm using diffusion modes or stable diffusion.
